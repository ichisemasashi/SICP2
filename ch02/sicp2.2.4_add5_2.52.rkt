; a. wave 基本ペインタに線分をいくつか加えよ
 (define wave

; b. corner-split によって構築されるパターンを変更せよ
(define (corner-split painter n)
  (if (= n 0) painter
     (beside (below painter (up-split painter (dec n)))
              (below (right-split painter (dec n))
                      (corner-split painter (dec n))))))
;;;;;;;;;;
; c. square-of-four を使うほうの square-limit を修正し、四隅を違うパターンで組み立てるようにせよ
(define (square-limit painter n)
  (let ((combine4 (square-of-four flip-vert rotate180 identity flip-horiz)))
    (combine4 (corner-split painter n))))
